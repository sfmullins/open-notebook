description: Facilitate Open Notebook's GitHub Discussions queue — qualify Ideas, decompose them into distinct needs, verify claims in code, propose outcomes (exploring / graduated / parked / combined), draft replies, and graduate small gaps into ready Issues. Use when processing, triaging, or responding to Discussions, or when the user says "process discussions" / "vamos fazer as discussions".

# Discussion Facilitation — Open Notebook

You are facilitating the community Discussion queue, implementing the
**qualification and exploration stages** of the Open Contribution system
([Discussion #1266](https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook/discussions/1266)
is the public essay; [#1212](https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook/discussions/1212)
is Bet #1). The maintainer (Luis) is the **decision owner**: every outcome
and reply is approved by him before posting. You prepare; he decides.

This process was calibrated by hand on 2026-08-16 across 10 Ideas
(#1210–#1265) and re-run on 2026-09-02 (6 follow-ups + 3 new ideas), which
added the `incubating` status and the pull rule. The patterns below are
ratified practice, not theory.

**Ground rules:**

- Interact with the owner in his language; everything posted to GitHub is
  **English**.
- **Never post, close, rename, or open anything without explicit approval**
  of the specific text. Present ficha + outcome + draft; wait for "aprovado".
- **Never cite internal maintainer drafts** (`.tmp-context/`, private plans).
  Public anchors only: `VISION.md`, `docs/7-DEVELOPMENT/decisions/` (ADRs/PDRs),
  open issues/PRs. Alignment with unpublished vision may be expressed as
  "aligns with where the product is heading" — no specifics.
- Status is stated **textually** in replies ("Status: **exploring**").
  No status labels on Discussions yet — that's a future bet.
- No bulk-migration of historical Issues. Small, theme-scoped samples only
  (Bet #1 explicitly reserved this), and only with approval.

## Phase 0 — Queue map (once per session)

Build the full picture before touching any single item. Cluster detection
across the queue is what makes individual replies good.

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
{ repository(owner: "lfnovo", name: "open-notebook") {
    discussions(first: 50, categoryId: "DIC_kwDONDsQ184CjkD_", orderBy: {field: CREATED_AT, direction: ASC}) {
      nodes { number title createdAt closed author { login } comments { totalCount } } } } }' \
  --jq '.data.repository.discussions.nodes[] | select(.closed == false) | "\(.number) | \(.createdAt[:10]) | \(.author.login) | comments:\(.comments.totalCount) | \(.title)"'
```

(Category `Ideas` = `DIC_kwDONDsQ184CjkD_`; `Feedback Requests` = `DIC_kwDONDsQ184DBrfp`.
Repo id: `R_kgDONDsQ1w`. These are GitHub GraphQL node ids for lfnovo/open-notebook;
they change if a category is recreated or the skill is used on a fork. Regenerate:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner: "lfnovo", name: "open-notebook") {
  id discussionCategories(first: 20) { nodes { id name } } } }'
```
)

Split into cohorts: post-Bet-#1 form entries (`[Idea]:` prefix) vs. pre-form
legacy. Note authors with multiple entries (their items often interconnect)
and candidate theme clusters. Present the map; agree on order (default:
chronological within the newest cohort).

**Classify processing state before proposing work** (learned on the legacy
cohort run): a discussion with a maintainer reply that already delivered an
outcome — especially one canonicalized in place — does **not** get a new
reply by default. For already-processed items the deliverable is a *state
ledger* (what's resolved and closable, what's canonical-awaiting-its-beat,
and which initiative each one is waiting on), plus at most the few actions
that state implies (e.g. closing a resolved thread with the outcome
recorded). Re-replying to handled threads is noise, not facilitation.

## Phase 1 — Ficha de contexto (per discussion)

1. **Fetch everything**: body + all comments (including reply threads).
   GraphQL, not `gh` CLI (discussions support is partial):
   `repository.discussion(number: N) { title body author { login } comments(...) }`.

2. **Decompose into distinct needs.** The single highest-value step.
   Titles undersell: "Thumbnails" was 3 needs; "manual annotations" was 4.
   Number them. Each need may get a different outcome and a different home.

3. **Search precedents** — issues, PRs, and discussions, multiple terms per
   need (`gh search issues` has no `--state all`; use `--include-prs`, watch
   for false positives like Python "annotations"). Check the queue map for
   sibling discussions.

4. **Verify claims in code before replying.** User reports — even their
   self-assessments — get checked against the actual implementation. This
   found two real bugs during calibration (editor hardcoded to light mode;
   Crawl4AI client sending no auth header). For upstream libraries use the
   local checkouts from `CLAUDE.local.md` (esperanto, content-core,
   podcast-creator, PostgreSQL command queue). State in the reply what was
   *verified*, distinctly from what is opinion.

5. **Check vision/decision alignment** against public records. PDR-001
   (single-user first) and its kin are citable and load-bearing.

## Phase 2 — Outcome proposal

Vocabulary (from the essay's qualification stage, as exercised):

| Outcome | When | Reply must include |
|---|---|---|
| **exploring** | Real, aligned problem; open solution space | Sharpening questions that actually shape the design |
| **incubating** | Direction decided, *timing* open (waits on vision fit, capacity, or a champion) | The settled spec, what it waits on, "this Discussion stays the home" |
| **accepted → graduated** | Someone will build it now: a builder (maintainer or champion) + closed spec | Issue(s) opened immediately — see graduation rules |
| **parked until champion** | Valid but needs a community owner (e.g. packaging channels) | Explicit return condition + how to volunteer |
| **combine** | Duplicate/facet of an existing theme | Link to the canonical home |
| **answer** | Already exists / documented | The answer, plus where docs fell short |
| **bug** | Reproducible defect | Graduate straight to a bug Issue |

**Graduation is pull, not push** (ratified 2026-09-02). An Issue is born
when someone is going to build it — never because the idea became clear.
`ready` is a promise of execution; filling it with well-discussed items and
no builder recreates the stale-backlog problem. A discussed-but-unscheduled
idea is **incubating** and the Discussion remains its home. Exceptions that
still graduate immediately: verified **bugs**, and small items the
maintainer will do next.

**Close on `answer`.** When the outcome is `answer` and the need has a
better home (an existing Issue, upstream, or "not planned"), post the reply
and close the Discussion as resolved (`closeDiscussion(reason: RESOLVED)`);
an open thread with a final answer clutters the queue. Anyone can reopen
with a new argument.

**Graduation rules** (for `accepted → graduated` and `bug`):
- Issue gets: Context (with Discussion origin link), Expected outcome,
  Out of scope, Acceptance criteria, References. Label `ready` (+ `bug` when
  applicable).
- **Route upstream** when the fix lives in a library (content-core,
  esperanto): open the upstream issue first, then the downstream
  bump/docs issue referencing it, then the reply citing both.
- A dependent downstream issue states "Depends on" explicitly.

**Canonical discussions:**
- Threshold: **3+ signals** on one theme → broaden an existing thread *in
  place* (rename via `updateDiscussion`; precedents #1154, #1250, #1254).
  At 2 signals, keep as a linked pair — no ceremony.
- Consolidating old Issues into a canon: close **solution-proposals** with
  an explanation comment (they become evidence); keep **execution umbrellas**
  open (they graduate when the vision call is made). Respect pointers from
  PDRs (#712 stays open because PDR-001 references it).
- Referencing issues in a reply creates backlinks on their timelines — free
  visibility, no mass edits needed.

## Phase 3 — Draft reply

Structure that worked, in order:

1. Open warm and specific (acknowledge genuinely good behavior: fresh-eyes
   framing, working prototypes, self-qualification, mockups).
2. **Mirror the decomposition back, numbered**, marking verified facts as
   verified ("I checked the code: ...").
3. If the use case is ambiguous — or the decision owner needed it explained —
   **play it back as a concrete worked example** ("Let me play this back —
   correct me where I get it wrong: In March you have 12 papers...").
4. Route each need to its home with links (canonical discussions, upstream
   issues, decision records).
5. Questions tailored to what actually shapes the design — not generic.
6. Invitations matched to the author's **participation checkboxes**:
   testers get test asks, implementers get building invites, design
   volunteers get design questions.
7. Close with `Status: **<outcome>**` plus a one-line summary of the routing.
8. When the answer is **no**, say it in the first paragraph with the reasons
   (e.g. "the runtime is about to change", "estimates for local models
   don't hold") — never let a decline hide behind exploration questions.
   Acknowledge real work (a prototype) without letting it change the answer.

Honesty rules: no feature promises, no timelines ("no commitment on timing
yet"); constraints stated with their reasons (link the PDR); "the door is
deliberately kept open" beats false enthusiasm and beats silence.

Style rules (owner feedback, 2026-08-16): no marketing filler or
throat-clearing — never "Fair question, and it deserves a straight answer" /
"Great idea!". Open by *answering*. Warmth comes from specificity
(acknowledging a working prototype, a good decomposition), not from
compliments about the question itself.

## Phase 4 — Approval gate, then post

Present to the owner: ficha (compact), proposed outcome, full draft reply,
and any issues/renames/closures the package includes. After approval:

- Write bodies to scratchpad files; post via GraphQL (`addDiscussionComment`,
  `updateDiscussion` for renames) with `-F body=@file` — avoids shell
  escaping.
- `gh issue create --label ready --body-file ...`; `gh issue close N
  --comment "$(cat file)"`.
- Order matters when linking: create issues first, then post the reply with
  real links.

## Session close

- Update the project memory (`open-contribution-workflow` memory file) with
  new patterns, posture decisions, and queue state.
- Report the scoreboard: discussions handled, outcomes by type, issues born,
  bugs found via verification.
- Surface skill-worthy learnings to the owner — this file evolves the same
  way it was born: from practice.
